# safety-app
There has been an increased rate in our campuses of late. The problem is the students donâ€™t have a way of reporting 
wheneverthey feel they are in danger or whenever they are attacked as it takes a long process to call somebody one knows.
so how can we solve this problem? I decided to come up with a mobile app that will simplify the process of reporting when
somebody is in danger. The app will incorporate google maps and GPRS in order to send signals of the specific place where
the victim is or where the crime is taking place. The app will operate as explained in the following lines. 
The users will be required to download the app from Google AppStore and install it in their smartphones.
They will be required to register to activate the app and to enable the school security to know who is sending the signal.
The user will also be required to enable GPRS in their phones for the app to work.so when a user is passing through a
place that seems dangerous, they are supposed to open the app in their phones and a red button will appear on their screens.
When the user suspects an attack or when they are attacked, they are just required to press the button and the signal will 
be automatically be sent to the campus security who will in turn rush to the victims rescue.
the app will operate in form of two app which i have uploaded,the admin app andstudent app
